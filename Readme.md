🔐 Authentication Flow

User registers or logs in

Passwords are hashed using bcrypt

On successful login, a JWT token is generated

Token is used to access protected routes

Middleware verifies JWT on each secured request

💳 Payment Flow (Stripe)

Order details are sent to the backend

Backend creates a Stripe Payment Intent

Client receives a client secret

Payment is securely completed on the frontend

Order is marked successful only after confirmation

All payment amounts are calculated and controlled on the backend to prevent tampering.
